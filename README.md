# IDMI IoT Testbed

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to produce an entire hardware/software suite that lets people configure, control and monitor their places the way they want.

The testbed includes the customized Arduino hardware designed specifically for the smart home/building scenario; a raspberry-pi device acting as an internet gateway for the Arduino devices; a server platform for managing and control those devices and interpret the device data; and, perhaps most importantly, mobile apps for Android and iOS so that you can control all of the smart gadgets/devices from one interface.

You can use the web and mobile apps to control anything that’s connected to the server, whether that’s a lighting system, an IP camera, or the locks on the door. It can become, in short, a remote control and monitor tool for your space.

It was inspired by [Calaos](http://calaos.fr/en/) project.
