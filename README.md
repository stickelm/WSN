## M2M/IoT
Can you explain what is IoT/M2M application?

Large fleet of cloud connected devices solving a business problem

(e.g. electrical power usage monitoring,turck fleet tracking)

#### Protocols
* XMPP
* MQTT
* COAP

#### Usages
* Monitoring(Devices,Enviroment)
* Device Management
  * Secure,monitor,manage large fleet of deployed devices
  * Configure the device
  * Update the firmware/app
  * Monitor and gather connectivity statistics
   
   Interoperability is the key!

    D.M. protocols
    * TR-069
    * OMA-DM
    * Lightweight M2M

* Device Control
