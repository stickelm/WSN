> The SX1276 covers all the major sub-GHz frequency bands while the SX1277 is a cost-optimized version targeted at applications that utilize data rates from 5 kbps to 40 kbps such as security systems.  The SX1278 is optimized for the rapidly growing smart meter market in China using the 470-510MHz band.  

> All devices deliver over 100dB of blocking immunity to out-of-band interfering signals, which is a 15dB advantage over competing devices.  Additionally, the SX127x family has a 25 dB improvement over FSK devices for rejecting in-band interfering signals. This makes the device especially effective in industrial, scientific and medical (ISM)-band applications such as security and metering because it provides immunity from sub-GHz frequency 4G/LTE signals. This immunity, combined with the SX127xx¡¯s highly linear RF front-end, makes it the most reliable and robust solution for operating in the presence of strong interfering signals.
